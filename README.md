        <h2>What Does This Model Do?</h2>
        <p>
            This project demonstrates a **Question Answering** model based on <strong>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)</strong>. 
            The model is designed to provide answers to specific questions based on a given context.
        </p>
        <p>
            By leveraging the power of the **RoBERTa-base fine-tuned on SQuAD2**, the model accurately identifies the most relevant span of text in the context that answers the given question.
        </p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Answers questions by analyzing a given context.</li>
            <li>Uses pre-trained BERT-based models for robust performance.</li>
            <li>Handles multiple languages and complex queries (depending on the pre-trained model).</li>
            <li>Can be used as a foundation for chatbot systems, customer support, or knowledge-base search tools.</li>
        </ul>

 <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>
            The model processes two inputs:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Question:</strong> The query you want answered.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Context:</strong> A passage of text containing the information needed to answer the question.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It then predicts the start and end positions of the answer within the context, returning the most likely answer span.
        </p>

<h2>Example Use Case</h2>
        <h3>Input</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Question:</strong> Why is conversion important?</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Context:</strong> The option to convert models between FARM and transformers gives freedom to the user and lets people easily switch between frameworks.
            </li>
        </ul>

 <h3>Output</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> to convert models between FARM and transformers</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Question:</strong> How many programming languages does BLOOM support?</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Context:</strong> BLOOM has 176 billion parameters and can generate text in 46 languages and 13 programming languages.
            </li>
        </ul>

 <h3>Output</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 13 programming languages</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating intelligent chatbots that answer customer queries.</li>
            <li>Improving search engines by providing direct answers instead of links.</li>
            <li>Building systems for legal or medical document analysis.</li>
            <li>Enhancing knowledge bases with natural language interfaces.</li>
        </ul>
